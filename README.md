Hello and welcome to my Project 2 for CS 107 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign!

Project Description: 
Using the Taiwan Travel Purpose dataset, I aimed to look at trends in Taiwan travel over time. After cleaning the data by removing nulls and duplicates, 
I grouped collection months together and calculated the total number of travelers per month. Following this, my dataset had 1,023 data points to be used for analysis. 
In my first visualization, I looked at the relationship between time and those traveling for business, finding a negative correlation between the two. This formed the
basis for my analysis in Section 4, where my alternative hypothesis stated there was a significant relationship between total travelers per month and time.
After visualizing the data and determining the r-coefficient, I was able to reject the null hypothesis. I then turned my sights to predicting the number of travelers per month.
I used a Linear Regression model to train 80% of my data, and then tested it on the remaining 20%. 
Then, I manually generated the equation for the line of best fit using the entirety of the data. Both appeaered to be relatively accurate. 
Afterwards, I compared the model predictions to those generated by the line of best fit, noting differences in both.
